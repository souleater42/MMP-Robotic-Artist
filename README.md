# MMP-Robotic-Artist
Robotic Artist (suggested by Helen Miles - hem23)  Description: 

The Intelligent Robotics Research Group are developing an exhibition for the general public.  

As part of this, I would like to investigate the development of a "Robotic Artist" who can draw images of visitors. My idea involves having a webcam photographing a visitor, then using image processing to produce a stylized portrait which can be drawn by a motorised plotter whiteboard.  Take a look at some of my inspiration for this project: 

Joto the internet-connected robotic whiteboard (one of many). - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joto/joto-the-first-connected-display-that-draws-with-a/description     

“Portrait drawing by Paul the robot”, a paper by Patrick Tresset and Frederic Fol Leymarie, Goldsmiths College. - http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~ma701pt/patricktresset/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/computerandgraphicstresset.pdf
